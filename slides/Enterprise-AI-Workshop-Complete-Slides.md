---

## Slide 12: Lab 1 Architecture
### LLM Integration Patterns
```
[Application] → [Circuit Breaker] → [Connection Pool] → [Ollama]
       ↓               ↓                 ↓               ↓
[Cost Tracker] [Health Monitor] [Retry Logic] [Load Balancer]
       ↓               ↓                 ↓               ↓
[Structured Logs] [Metrics] [Performance Data] [Error Handling]
```

**Enterprise Components:**

**Speaker Notes:** This isn't just an API call - it's a complete enterprise integration with all the operational controls needed for production.

---

## Slide 13: Lab 1 Key Concepts
### Production-First Mindset
**Core Principles:**
1. **Never trust external services** - always have fallbacks
2. **Monitor everything** - response times, costs, errors
3. **Log for operations** - structured logs with correlation IDs
4. **Design for scale** - connection pooling, timeout handling

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Direct API calls without error handling
- Blocking operations without timeouts
- Unstructured logging
- No cost visibility

**Speaker Notes:** These principles apply to any external service integration, not just LLMs. This mindset shift is crucial for production systems.

---

## Slide 14: Lab 1 Error Handling Strategy
### Resilience Patterns
**Circuit Breaker States:**
- **Closed:** Normal operation
- **Open:** Service unavailable, fail fast
- **Half-Open:** Testing if service recovered

**Fallback Strategies:**
- Cached responses for common queries
- Simplified rule-based responses
- Graceful degradation messages
- Human agent escalation

**Speaker Notes:** In production, the LLM will fail. We need strategies to keep the customer service system operational even when the AI is down.

---

## Slide 15: Lab 1 Monitoring & Observability
### What to Monitor
**Performance Metrics:**
