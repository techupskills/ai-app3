response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

---

## **Slide 8: Enterprise LLM Architecture**
### Production-Ready Service Design

**Configuration-Driven Architecture:**
```yaml
llm:
  model: "llama3.2:3b"
  timeout: 30
  max_retries: 3
  rate_limit_per_minute: 60

circuit_breaker:
  failure_threshold: 5
  recovery_timeout: 60

security:
  input_max_length: 10000
  rate_limiting_enabled: true
```

---

## **Slide 9: Circuit Breaker Pattern for AI**
### Preventing Cascade Failures

**The Problem:**
- LLM service becomes slow or unavailable
- Dependent services keep calling and timing out
- System resources exhausted by failing requests
- Entire application becomes unresponsive

**Circuit Breaker Solution:**
```
[CLOSED] → Normal operation, monitor failures
     ↓ (failure threshold exceeded)
[OPEN] → Fast-fail, return error immediately
     ↓ (after timeout period)
[HALF-OPEN] → Test with single request
     ↓ (success/failure)
[CLOSED]/[OPEN] → Resume normal operation or fail again
```

**Business Benefits:**
- Prevents customer-facing failures
- Maintains system responsiveness
- Enables graceful degradation
- Reduces infrastructure costs during outages

**Speaker Notes:**
- Explain how failures cascade in distributed systems
- Walk through circuit breaker state transitions
- Emphasize customer experience protection
- Give examples of graceful degradation strategies

---

## **Slide 10: Cost Management and Monitoring**
### Tracking ROI and Performance

**Cost Tracking Implementation:**
```python
def track_usage(self, tokens_used: int, cost: float):
    self.usage_stats["total_requests"] += 1
    self.usage_stats["total_tokens"] += tokens_used
    self.usage_stats["total_cost"] += cost
    
    # Alert if approaching budget limit
    if self.usage_stats["total_cost"] > self.daily_budget * 0.8:
        self.alert_finance_team()
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Cost per Interaction:** $0.002 target vs. actual

    # Length limits to prevent DoS
    if len(prompt) > self.max_input_length:
        return False
    
    # Check for injection attempts
    suspicious_patterns = ['<script>', 'DROP TABLE', ...]
    for pattern in suspicious_patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in prompt.lower():
            return False
    
    return True

**Typical AI Application Anti-Pattern:**
```python
def handle_customer_query(query: str) -> str:
    # Everything mixed together
    if not query or len(query) > 1000:
        return "Invalid query"
    
    # Direct LLM call
    response = requests.post("http://llm-service", json={"prompt": query})
    
    # Direct database access
    if "billing" in query:
        db_result = database.query("SELECT * FROM billing...")
    
    # Business logic mixed with infrastructure
    if response.status_code != 200:

    def __init__(self, 
                 llm_service: ILLMService,
                 knowledge_service: IKnowledgeService,
                 escalation_service: IEscalationService,
                 audit_service: IAuditService):
        # Dependency injection enables testing and flexibility
        self.llm_service = llm_service

    @abstractmethod
    def call_llm(self, prompt: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        pass

class IKnowledgeService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def search_knowledge(self, query: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        pass

    try:
        # Validate input
        if not self._validate_input(query):
            return self._create_validation_error_response()
        
        # Enrich context with error handling
        enriched_context = self._enrich_context_safely(query, customer_context)
        
        # Generate response with fallbacks
        return self._generate_response_with_fallbacks(enriched_context)
        
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")
        # Always provide graceful degradation
        return self._escalate_to_human_with_context(query, str(e))
```

**Error Handling Levels:**
1. **Input Validation:** Prevent invalid requests
2. **Service Failures:** Graceful fallbacks
3. **Timeout Handling:** SLA-compliant responses
4. **Escalation:** Human handoff when AI fails

**Speaker Notes:**

    correlation_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    
    self.logger.info(f"Query started", extra={
        "correlation_id": correlation_id,
        "customer_id": customer_context.customer_id
    })
    
    try:
        result = self._process_query(query, customer_context)
        response_time = time.time() - start_time
        
        # SLA monitoring
        if response_time > 2.0:
            self._alert_sla_violation(correlation_id, response_time)
        
        return result

        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "conversation_id": conversation_id,
        "event_type": "customer_interaction",
        "customer_id": data.get("customer_id"),

        "escalated": data.get("escalated", False),
        "response_time": data.get("response_time"),
        "agent_id": data.get("agent_id")
    }
    
    # Write to secure audit log
    self.audit_logger.info(json.dumps(audit_entry))
```

    real_knowledge_service = KnowledgeService()
    agent = CustomerServiceAgent(knowledge_service=real_knowledge_service)
    
    result = agent.handle_customer_query("What's your return policy?")
    assert "return policy" in result["response"].lower()

# Performance Tests - Test SLA compliance
def test_response_time_sla():
    start_time = time.time()
    result = agent.handle_customer_query("Help with billing")

        # Extract JWT token from Authorization header
        token = request.headers.get("Authorization", "").replace("Bearer ", "")
        
        try:
            # Validate token signature and expiration
            payload = jwt.decode(token, self.secret_key, algorithms=["HS256"])
            
            # Check user permissions for requested service
            if not self.check_permissions(payload["user_id"], request.path):
                raise HTTPException(401, "Insufficient permissions")
            
            return {
                "user_id": payload["user_id"],
                "role": payload["role"],
                "permissions": payload["permissions"]
            }

        ↓
   Load Balancer
        ↓
   Blue Environment (Current Version 1.0)
   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ● Customer Service v1.0         │
   │ ● Knowledge Base v1.0           │
   │ ● Dashboard v1.0                │
   └─────────────────────────────────┘

Green Environment (New Version 1.1)
   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ● Customer Service v1.1 (Testing)│
   │ ● Knowledge Base v1.1           │
   │ ● Dashboard v1.1                │
   └─────────────────────────────────┘

Deployment Process:
1. Deploy v1.1 to Green environment
2. Run automated tests on Green
3. Switch traffic to Green (v1.1)
4. Monitor for issues
5. Keep Blue (v1.0) for instant rollback
```

**Canary Deployment for AI:**
```

    response_time = end_time - start_time
    if response_time > SLA_THRESHOLD:
        alert_operations_team("SLA violation", operation, response_time)

# 2. Traffic - How much demand?
@counter
def track_request_volume(endpoint, user_role):
    if get_current_rps() > CAPACITY_THRESHOLD:
        trigger_auto_scaling()

# 3. Errors - What is failing?
@counter
def track_error_rate(error_type, service):
    error_rate = calculate_error_rate()
    if error_rate > ERROR_THRESHOLD:
        escalate_to_engineering_team()
