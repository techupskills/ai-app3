# Lab 6: Production Deployment and Monitoring

**Purpose:** Deploy TechCorp's customer service AI to production using enterprise deployment patterns, containerization, monitoring, and CI/CD best practices with HuggingFace Spaces.

**Time:** 20 minutes

**Business Context:** Complete TechCorp's AI customer service system by deploying it to production with enterprise-grade monitoring, scaling, health checks, and operational procedures that meet business SLA requirements.

## Steps

1. **Review production deployment architecture**
   ```bash
   ls -la deployment/
   cat deployment/docker-compose.yml
   cat deployment/kubernetes/
   ```

2. **Create production Dockerfile**
   ```bash
   code Dockerfile
   ```

3. **Implement enterprise Docker patterns**
   ```bash
   code -d ../extra/lab6-Dockerfile Dockerfile
   ```
   **Enterprise Docker patterns to observe:**
   - Multi-stage builds for optimization
   - Security hardening and non-root users
   - Health checks and readiness probes
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Resource limits and constraints

4. **Create production environment configuration**
   ```bash
   code deployment/production.env
   ```

5. **Complete production configuration**
   ```bash
   code -d ../extra/lab6-production.env deployment/production.env
   ```

6. **Create deployment orchestration**
   ```bash
   code deployment/docker-compose.prod.yml
   ```

7. **Implement orchestration patterns**
   ```bash
   code -d ../extra/lab6-docker-compose.prod.yml deployment/docker-compose.prod.yml
   ```

8. **Build and test production container**
   ```bash
   docker build -t techcorp-ai-service:latest .
   docker run --env-file deployment/production.env -p 8501:8501 techcorp-ai-service:latest
   ```

9. **Create HuggingFace Spaces deployment**
   ```bash
   code spaces_app.py
   ```

10. **Complete HuggingFace deployment**
    ```bash
    code -d ../extra/lab6-spaces_app.py spaces_app.py
    ```

11. **Create monitoring and observability**
    ```bash
    code monitoring/prometheus_config.yml
    code monitoring/grafana_dashboard.json
    ```

12. **Complete monitoring setup**
    ```bash
    code -d ../extra/lab6-prometheus_config.yml monitoring/prometheus_config.yml
    code -d ../extra/lab6-grafana_dashboard.json monitoring/grafana_dashboard.json
    ```

13. **Deploy to HuggingFace Spaces:**
    - Create new Space: `techcorp-customer-service-ai`
    - Upload: `spaces_app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`
    - Configure: Gradio SDK, public/private visibility
    - Monitor: Build logs and deployment status

14. **Test production deployment:**
    ```bash
    # Health check
    curl http://localhost:8501/health
    
    # Load testing
    python scripts/load_test.py
    
    # Monitor metrics
    docker exec -it techcorp-ai-service cat /app/metrics/performance.json
    ```

15. **Verify enterprise features:**
    - **High Availability:** Multiple container instances
    - **Auto Scaling:** Resource-based scaling triggers
    - **Health Monitoring:** Liveness and readiness probes
    - **Log Aggregation:** Centralized logging with correlation IDs
    - **Performance Metrics:** Response times, throughput, error rates
    - **Security:** Container scanning, secrets management

**Enterprise Deployment Architecture:**
- **Containerization:** Docker with multi-stage builds and security hardening
- **Orchestration:** Docker Compose and Kubernetes deployment manifests
- **Service Mesh:** Load balancing, service discovery, and traffic routing
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, alerting rules
- **Logging:** Centralized logging with ELK stack integration
- **Security:** Container scanning, secrets management, network policies

**Production Features:**
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment:** Rolling updates with health checks
- **Auto-Scaling:** Horizontal pod autoscaling based on metrics
- **Circuit Breakers:** Fault tolerance and cascading failure prevention
- **Rate Limiting:** API throttling and DDoS protection
- **Backup and Recovery:** Automated backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Compliance:** SOC 2, GDPR compliance with audit trails

**Monitoring and Observability:**
- **Application Metrics:** Custom business metrics and KPIs
- **Infrastructure Metrics:** CPU, memory, network, disk utilization
- **Distributed Tracing:** Request tracing across microservices
- **Error Tracking:** Automated error detection and alerting
- **Performance APM:** Application performance monitoring
- **Business Intelligence:** Customer satisfaction and operational metrics

**Best Practices Demonstrated:**
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Declarative deployment configurations
- **GitOps:** Version-controlled infrastructure and application deployments
- **Security Scanning:** Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- **Performance Testing:** Load testing and capacity planning
- **Disaster Recovery:** Backup strategies and failover procedures
- **Compliance:** Audit logging and data governance

**HuggingFace Spaces Deployment:**
- **Public Demo:** Customer-facing demonstration of AI capabilities
- **Enterprise Integration:** API endpoints for business system integration
- **Model Versioning:** Automated model updates and rollbacks
- **Performance Optimization:** Caching and GPU acceleration
- **Security:** Authentication for sensitive operations
- **Analytics:** Usage tracking and user behavior analysis

**Expected Outcome:** Production-ready deployment of TechCorp's customer service AI with enterprise monitoring, scaling, and operational procedures that meet business SLA requirements of 99.9% uptime and sub-2-second response times.

**Business Value:** This deployment strategy enables TechCorp to confidently operate their AI customer service system at scale, with proper monitoring and operational procedures that ensure business continuity and customer satisfaction.
