**Follow the startup instructions in the README.md file IF NOT ALREADY DONE!**

**NOTE: To copy and paste in the codespace, you may need to use keyboard commands - CTRL-C and CTRL-V. Chrome may work best for this.**

**Lab 1 - Enterprise LLM Integration Patterns**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll build a production-ready LLM client with enterprise security, monitoring, and error handling patterns for TechCorp's customer support system.**

1. First, let's verify that our enterprise environment is properly set up. Go to the *TERMINAL* tab in the bottom part of your codespace and run the environment verification script.
```bash
./scripts/verify_environment.sh
```

2. You should see checkmarks for Python, Ollama, and the Llama 3.2 model. If anything is missing, the script will provide instructions to fix it.

3. Now let's examine the enterprise configuration that drives our LLM service. Look at the YAML configuration file that contains enterprise settings for security, performance, and monitoring.
```bash
cat config/app_config.yaml
```

4. Notice the enterprise patterns: circuit breaker settings, logging configuration, security controls, and business settings like cost tracking.

5. For this lab, we'll create an enterprise-grade LLM service. The file name is *enterprise_llm_service.py* in the *lab1* directory. Navigate to that directory and open the skeleton file.
```bash
cd lab1
code enterprise_llm_service.py
```

6. This skeleton shows the enterprise architecture we'll implement: configuration management, circuit breakers, performance monitoring, and comprehensive error handling. Now let's complete the implementation using our diff-merge approach.
```bash
code -d ../extra/lab1-enterprise_llm_service.py enterprise_llm_service.py
```

7. As you merge each section, notice the enterprise patterns being implemented:
   - **Configuration Management**: YAML-driven settings with environment variable overrides
   - **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatic failure detection and recovery
   - **Structured Logging**: Correlation IDs for request tracing
   - **Security**: Input validation and rate limiting
   - **Cost Management**: Token usage tracking and budget controls
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Response time tracking and SLA monitoring

8. Once you've merged all sections and saved the file, let's test our enterprise LLM service.
```bash
python enterprise_llm_service.py
```

9. Try these enterprise scenarios to see the patterns in action:
   - **Normal Query**: "How do I reset my password?"
   - **Business Query**: "What's your return policy for enterprise customers?"
   - **Load Testing**: Enter multiple rapid queries to see rate limiting
   - **Error Handling**: Try an empty query to see validation

10. Check the enterprise monitoring features by reviewing the logs and metrics:
```bash
tail logs/app.log
cat metrics/usage_stats.json
```

11. Notice how every request is logged with correlation IDs, performance metrics are tracked, and costs are calculated. Type 'health' to see the service health status, or 'stats' to see usage statistics.

12. The circuit breaker protects against failures. You can see its current state in the health output. In production, this prevents cascade failures across microservices.

**Lab 2 - Production Agent Architecture**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll build a customer service agent using enterprise architecture patterns with proper separation of concerns, dependency injection, and comprehensive error handling.**

1. Change to the lab2 directory and examine the enterprise service layer architecture we'll be implementing.
```bash
cd ../lab2
ls -la services/
cat services/__init__.py
```

2. Notice how we've separated concerns into different service interfaces. This enables dependency injection, testing, and flexibility. Now let's look at the customer service agent skeleton.
```bash
code customer_service_agent.py
```

3. This shows the clean architecture pattern with dependency injection. All services are injected as interfaces, making the code testable and maintainable. Let's complete the implementation.
```bash
code -d ../extra/lab2-customer_service_agent.py customer_service_agent.py
```

4. As you merge the sections, observe these enterprise architecture patterns:
   - **Dependency Injection**: Services injected via constructor for testability
   - **Interface Segregation**: Each service has a focused, single-responsibility interface
   - **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic separated from infrastructure concerns
   - **Enterprise Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with graceful degradation
   - **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for compliance requirements
   - **Performance Monitoring**: SLA tracking with alerting for violations

5. Notice the mock service implementations at the bottom. In production, these would connect to real enterprise systems like CRM, knowledge bases, and ticketing systems.

6. Now let's test our enterprise customer service agent:
```bash
python customer_service_agent.py
```

7. Try these enterprise customer service scenarios:
   - **Account Issues**: "I can't access my account and need help immediately"
   - **Billing Questions**: "Why was I charged twice this month? This is unacceptable!"
   - **Technical Support**: "My application keeps crashing every time I try to save"
   - **Escalation Test**: "I want to speak to your manager right now!"

8. Notice how the agent handles different types of queries and automatically escalates when appropriate. Check the performance metrics:
```bash
# In the application, type 'metrics' to see performance data
```

9. Review the enterprise logging and audit trails that were created:
```bash
tail logs/customer_service.log
tail logs/audit.log
```

10. The audit log shows complete compliance tracking - who accessed what, when, and what the outcome was. This is essential for enterprise compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.).

11. Notice how response times are tracked against SLA requirements (2 seconds). In production, violations would trigger alerts to operations teams.

12. The service demonstrates graceful degradation - if the LLM fails, it escalates to human agents rather than showing error messages to customers.

**Lab 3 - MCP Architecture for Enterprise Scalability**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll refactor the customer service agent to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) for distributed architecture, service discovery, and enterprise scalability patterns.**

1. Change to the lab3 directory and examine the enterprise MCP service registry configuration.
```bash
cd ../lab3
cat mcp_services/service_registry.json
```

2. This configuration defines the enterprise service mesh with health checks, rate limits, SLA requirements, and security settings. Notice the enterprise features like authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring.

3. Let's create the MCP customer service server. This will be our distributed service that other systems can discover and call.
```bash
code mcp_customer_service_server.py
```

4. The skeleton shows the enterprise MCP server architecture with middleware for authentication, rate limiting, and circuit breakers. Let's complete the implementation.
```bash
code -d ../extra/lab3-mcp_customer_service_server.py mcp_customer_service_server.py
```

5. As you merge the server implementation, notice these enterprise distributed system patterns:
   - **Service Registration**: Automatic discovery and health monitoring
   - **Authentication Middleware**: JWT token validation for security
   - **Rate Limiting**: Per-client request throttling
   - **Circuit Breakers**: Fault tolerance for downstream services
   - **Distributed Tracing**: Request correlation across services
   - **Health Endpoints**: Kubernetes-style health and readiness probes

6. Now let's start the MCP server in the background:
```bash
python mcp_customer_service_server.py &
```

7. The server will start on port 8000 with health monitoring. You should see logs indicating successful startup and service registration.

8. Now let's create the MCP client that will discover and call our distributed services. Open a new terminal and navigate back to lab3.
```bash
# Right-click in terminal and select "Split Terminal" or open new terminal
cd lab3
code mcp_customer_service_client.py
```

9. Complete the enterprise MCP client implementation:
```bash
code -d ../extra/lab3-mcp_customer_service_client.py mcp_customer_service_client.py
```

10. The client demonstrates these enterprise patterns:
    - **Service Discovery**: Automatic endpoint detection
    - **Load Balancing**: Round-robin across healthy instances
    - **Retry Policies**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
    - **Distributed Tracing**: Request correlation across services
    - **Circuit Breakers**: Client-side failure protection
    - **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback responses when services unavailable

11. Now test the distributed customer service system:
```bash
python mcp_customer_service_client.py
```

12. Try these enterprise scenarios to test the distributed architecture:
    - **Normal Operations**: "What's your refund policy?"
    - **Service Discovery**: Type 'services' to see discovered services
    - **Load Testing**: Multiple rapid queries to test rate limiting
    - **Resilience Testing**: Stop the server (Ctrl+C in server terminal) and try queries

13. Monitor the distributed system health:
```bash
# In another terminal
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics
```

14. Notice how the client automatically handles service failures with fallback responses. This prevents user-facing errors when distributed services have issues.

15. (Optional) Start multiple server instances to see load balancing:
```bash
# In additional terminals
MCP_PORT=8001 python mcp_customer_service_server.py &
MCP_PORT=8002 python mcp_customer_service_server.py &
```

16. The client will automatically discover the new instances and distribute load across them. This demonstrates horizontal scaling in enterprise environments.

1. Change to the lab4 directory and examine the enterprise knowledge base configuration.
```bash
cd ../lab4
cat knowledge_base/data_sources.yaml
```

2. This configuration defines our enterprise data sources with access controls, update frequencies, and compliance settings. Notice the role-based access and version control requirements.

3. Let's examine the enterprise documents that will populate our knowledge base:
```bash
ls -la ../data/enterprise_docs/
head -20 ../data/enterprise_docs/company_policies.md
```

4. These documents contain realistic enterprise content: policies, technical documentation, and FAQs with proper classification and access controls.

5. Now let's create the enterprise RAG service. Open the skeleton file:
```bash
code enterprise_rag_service.py
```

6. The skeleton shows the enterprise RAG architecture with document processing, access control, and performance monitoring. Let's complete the implementation.
```bash
code -d ../extra/lab4-enterprise_rag_service.py enterprise_rag_service.py
```

7. As you merge the implementation, observe these enterprise RAG patterns:
   - **Document Processing Pipeline**: Validation, classification, and chunking
   - **Access Control**: Role-based document filtering
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Query timing and cache hit rates
   - **Citation Tracking**: Source attribution for compliance
   - **Vector Database**: ChromaDB with enterprise configuration
   - **Metadata Management**: Rich metadata for governance

8. First, let's initialize the knowledge base by ingesting the enterprise documents:
```bash
python enterprise_rag_service.py --mode=ingest
```

9. You should see the documents being processed, classified, and indexed. Notice the enterprise metadata being preserved for each document chunk.

10. Now let's test the knowledge retrieval capabilities:
```bash
python enterprise_rag_service.py --mode=search
```

11. Try these enterprise knowledge queries:
    - **Policy Questions**: "What's the return policy for enterprise customers?"
    - **Technical Support**: "How do I integrate with the TechCorp API?"
    - **Security Procedures**: "What are the data retention requirements?"
    - **Billing Information**: "What payment methods are accepted?"

12. Notice how each response includes citations and source attribution. This is critical for enterprise compliance and trust.

13. Now let's integrate RAG with our customer service agent. Create the RAG-enhanced agent:
```bash
code rag_enhanced_agent.py
```

14. Complete the RAG integration:
```bash
code -d ../extra/lab4-rag_enhanced_agent.py rag_enhanced_agent.py
```

15. This integration shows how to combine LLM reasoning with enterprise knowledge retrieval while maintaining security and performance requirements.

16. Test the RAG-enhanced customer service:
```bash
python rag_enhanced_agent.py
```

17. Try these scenarios that require knowledge base access:
    - **Policy Questions**: "I'm an enterprise customer, what's my return window?"
    - **API Integration**: "I need help setting up OAuth for your API"
    - **Billing Procedures**: "Can I pay with purchase orders?"
    - **Security Compliance**: "What encryption do you use for data?"

18. Review the enterprise performance and governance metrics:
```bash
cat metrics/rag_performance.json
tail logs/knowledge_access.log
tail logs/citation_tracking.log
```

19. Notice how every knowledge access is logged for audit purposes, and performance metrics track retrieval times and cache effectiveness.

20. The system demonstrates enterprise data governance - documents are classified, access is controlled by role, and all usage is audited for compliance.
