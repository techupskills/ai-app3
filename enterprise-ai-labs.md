This workshop builds a complete **TechCorp Customer Service AI System** using enterprise patterns throughout. You'll create 8 interconnected services that demonstrate production-ready AI development.

**What You'll Build:**
- Enterprise LLM integration with resilience patterns
- Production customer service agent
- Distributed MCP service architecture  
- Enterprise RAG system with governance
- Real-time operational dashboard
- Container deployment with monitoring

**Enterprise Focus:** Every lab emphasizes security, scalability, monitoring, and business value.

---

## Lab 1 - Enterprise LLM Integration (10 minutes, 8 steps)

**Purpose: Build production-ready LLM client with enterprise security, monitoring, and error handling patterns for TechCorp's customer support system.**

1. First, let's verify that our enterprise environment is properly set up. Go to the *TERMINAL* tab in the bottom part of your codespace and run the environment verification script.
```bash
./scripts/verify_environment.sh
```

2. You should see checkmarks for Python, Ollama, and the Llama 3.2 model. If anything is missing, the script will provide instructions to fix it.

3. Now let's examine the enterprise configuration that drives our LLM service. Look at the YAML configuration file that contains enterprise settings for security, performance, and monitoring.
```bash
cat config/app_config.yaml
```

4. Notice the enterprise patterns: circuit breaker settings, logging configuration, security controls, and business settings like cost tracking.

5. For this lab, we'll create an enterprise-grade LLM service. The file name is *enterprise_llm_service.py* in the *lab1* directory. Navigate to that directory and open the skeleton file.
```bash
cd lab1
code enterprise_llm_service.py
```

6. This skeleton shows the enterprise architecture we'll implement: configuration management, circuit breakers, performance monitoring, and comprehensive error handling. Now let's complete the implementation using our diff-merge approach.
```bash
code -d ../extra/lab1-enterprise_llm_service.py enterprise_llm_service.py
```

7. As you merge each section, notice the enterprise patterns being implemented:
   - **Configuration Management**: YAML-driven settings with environment variable overrides
   - **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatic failure detection and recovery
   - **Structured Logging**: Correlation IDs for request tracing
   - **Security**: Input validation and rate limiting
   - **Cost Management**: Token usage tracking and budget controls
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Response time tracking and SLA monitoring

8. Once you've merged all sections and saved the file, let's test our enterprise LLM service.
```bash
python enterprise_llm_service.py
```

**Enterprise Validation:** Your LLM service now has circuit breakers, monitoring, and cost tracking - ready for production deployment.

---

## Lab 2 - Production Agent Architecture (12 minutes, 10 steps)

**Purpose: Create intelligent customer service agent with context management, escalation logic, and enterprise monitoring.**

1. Navigate to the lab2 directory and examine the agent architecture skeleton.
```bash
cd ../lab2
code customer_service_agent.py
```

2. This skeleton implements a layered architecture with dependency injection, service abstractions, and comprehensive error handling. Let's complete the implementation.
```bash
code -d ../extra/lab2-customer_service_agent.py customer_service_agent.py
```

3. As you merge, observe the **Clean Architecture** patterns:
   - **Service Layer**: Business logic separated from infrastructure
   - **Dependency Injection**: Testable and maintainable code structure
   - **Context Management**: Conversation state preservation
   - **Escalation Logic**: Intelligent human handoff triggers

4. Create the agent configuration file with business rules and escalation triggers.
```bash
cp ../config/agent_config.yaml .
```

5. Initialize the conversation context database for state management.
```bash
python -c "from production_customer_agent import ConversationContextManager; ConversationContextManager().initialize_database()"
```

6. Test the agent with a simple customer query to verify basic functionality.
```bash
python production_customer_agent.py
```

7. Try different query types to see the agent's response routing in action:
   - Billing question: "I have a question about my invoice"
   - Technical issue: "My application is not working properly"
   - Escalation trigger: "I'm very frustrated with your service"

8. Examine the structured logs to see enterprise monitoring in action.
```bash
tail -f logs/agent_performance.log
```

9. Check the conversation audit trail for compliance and improvement.
```bash
cat logs/conversation_audit.log
```

10. Review the performance metrics dashboard data.
```bash
python -c "from production_customer_agent import AgentPerformanceTracker; print(AgentPerformanceTracker().get_metrics_summary())"
```

**Enterprise Validation:** Your agent now handles complex conversations with proper escalation, audit trails, and performance monitoring.

```

6. In a new terminal, test the authentication system.
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}'
```

7. Test the MCP tools with authenticated requests (use the token from step 6).
```bash
export TOKEN="your_jwt_token_here"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tool": "search_knowledge", "params": {"query": "billing question"}}'
```

8. Monitor the health endpoints for load balancer integration.
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/ready
```

9. Check the structured audit logs for security compliance.
```bash
tail -f logs/mcp_server_audit.log
```

**Enterprise Validation:** Your MCP server provides secure, scalable API access with comprehensive monitoring and enterprise controls.

   - **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end observability

4. Copy the client configuration with discovery and resilience settings.
```bash
cp ../config/mcp_client_config.yaml .
```

5. Test the service discovery and connection logic.
```bash
python mcp_customer_service_client.py
```

6. Simulate service failures to test circuit breaker behavior.
```bash
# Stop the MCP server from lab3, then test client resilience
python -c "from mcp_customer_service_client import MCPClient; client = MCPClient(); client.test_resilience_patterns()"
```

7. Restart the MCP server and observe automatic recovery.
```bash
cd ../lab3
python mcp_customer_service_server.py &
cd ../lab4
```

8. Check distributed tracing logs to see request correlation.
```bash
tail -f logs/distributed_trace.log
```
