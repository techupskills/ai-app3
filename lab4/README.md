# Lab 4: Enterprise Knowledge Base with RAG

**Purpose:** Integrate a production-grade RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system into TechCorp's customer service platform with enterprise data pipelines, security, and performance optimization.

**Time:** 15 minutes

**Business Context:** Build TechCorp's intelligent knowledge management system that can process company documentation, support articles, and policies to provide accurate, cited responses to customer inquiries while maintaining data governance and security.

## Steps

1. **Review enterprise knowledge architecture**
   ```bash
   ls -la knowledge_base/
   cat knowledge_base/data_sources.yaml
   ls -la data/enterprise_docs/
   ```

2. **Examine enterprise document collection**
   ```bash
   ls -la data/enterprise_docs/
   # Review: policies, procedures, FAQs, technical documentation
   ```

3. **Create the enterprise RAG service**
   ```bash
   code enterprise_rag_service.py
   ```

4. **Implement enterprise RAG patterns**
   ```bash
   code -d ../extra/lab4-enterprise_rag_service.py enterprise_rag_service.py
   ```
   **Enterprise RAG patterns to observe:**
   - Document ingestion pipeline with validation
   - Chunk optimization for enterprise content
   - Metadata preservation for citations and governance
   - Access control and data classification
   - Performance monitoring and query optimization
   - Multi-modal document processing (PDF, Word, HTML)

5. **Initialize and test the knowledge base**
   ```bash
   python enterprise_rag_service.py --mode=ingest
   ```

6. **Test knowledge retrieval**
   ```bash
   python enterprise_rag_service.py --mode=search
   ```

7. **Integrate RAG with customer service agent**
   ```bash
   code rag_enhanced_agent.py
   ```

8. **Complete the RAG integration**
   ```bash
   code -d ../extra/lab4-rag_enhanced_agent.py rag_enhanced_agent.py
   ```

9. **Test the RAG-enhanced customer service**
   ```bash
   python rag_enhanced_agent.py
   ```

10. **Try enterprise knowledge queries:**
    - **Policy Questions:** "What's the return policy for enterprise customers?"
    - **Technical Documentation:** "How do I integrate the TechCorp API?"
    - **Billing Procedures:** "What payment methods are accepted?"
    - **Security Policies:** "What are the data retention requirements?"

11. **Review performance and governance metrics**
    ```bash
    cat metrics/rag_performance.json
    cat logs/knowledge_access.log
    tail logs/citation_tracking.log
    ```

12. **Test data governance features:**
    - Query classification and routing
    - Citation tracking and source attribution
    - Access control by document classification
    - Performance optimization for large document sets

**Enterprise RAG Architecture:**
- **Document Pipeline:** Automated ingestion with validation and classification
- **Vector Database:** ChromaDB with enterprise configuration and backup
- **Embedding Service:** Sentence transformers with caching and performance monitoring
- **Access Control:** Role-based access to sensitive documents
- **Citation Tracking:** Full audit trail of source documents used
- **Performance Optimization:** Caching, query optimization, and load balancing

**Production Features:**
- **Data Classification:** Automatic tagging of sensitive/confidential content
- **Multi-tenancy:** Customer-specific knowledge bases with isolation
- **Version Control:** Document versioning and change tracking
- **Compliance:** GDPR/SOX compliance with audit trails
- **Performance SLAs:** Sub-200ms retrieval with 99.9% availability
- **Security:** Encryption at rest and in transit, access logging

**Best Practices Demonstrated:**
- **Document Processing:** Intelligent chunking with context preservation
- **Metadata Management:** Rich metadata for governance and routing
- **Query Optimization:** Vector similarity with keyword boosting
- **Caching Strategy:** Multi-level caching for performance
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation when knowledge base unavailable
- **Monitoring:** Real-time performance and accuracy metrics

**Expected Outcome:** Production-ready RAG system that can handle enterprise document collections, provide accurate responses with citations, and maintain strict data governance and security standards.

**Business Value:** This RAG system enables TechCorp customer service agents to provide accurate, policy-compliant responses backed by authoritative company documentation, reducing escalations by 60% and improving customer satisfaction scores.
