# Lab 1: Enterprise LLM Integration Patterns

**Purpose:** Build a production-ready LLM client with enterprise security, monitoring, and error handling patterns.

**Time:** 15 minutes

**Business Context:** Create the foundation LLM service for TechCorp's customer support system with proper logging, cost tracking, and resilience patterns.

## Steps

1. **Verify enterprise environment setup**
   ```bash
   ollama list
   cat config/app_config.yaml
   ```
   Verify `llama3.2:3b` model and configuration files are present.

2. **Create the enterprise LLM service** - Create `enterprise_llm_service.py`:
   ```bash
   code enterprise_llm_service.py
   ```

3. **Implement enterprise patterns** - Use diff view to understand production patterns:
   ```bash
   code -d ../extra/lab1-enterprise_llm_service.py enterprise_llm_service.py
   ```
   **Key patterns to observe:**
   - Configuration management with environment variables
   - Structured logging with correlation IDs
   - Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
   - Token usage tracking for cost management
   - Input validation and sanitization

4. **Test the enterprise service**
   ```bash
   python enterprise_llm_service.py
   ```
   Try business-relevant prompts:
   - "How do I reset my password?"
   - "What's your return policy?"
   - "I need help with my billing"

5. **Review logs and metrics**
   ```bash
   tail logs/app.log
   cat metrics/usage_stats.json
   ```

6. **Test error handling** - Try invalid inputs to see graceful degradation.

**Enterprise Best Practices Demonstrated:**
- Configuration-driven architecture
- Comprehensive error handling and circuit breakers
- Structured logging for observability
- Cost tracking and usage monitoring
- Security through input validation
- Performance optimization with connection pooling

**Expected Outcome:** Production-ready LLM service that can handle enterprise workloads with proper monitoring and resilience.

**Business Value:** This foundation service enables TechCorp to integrate AI into customer support while maintaining enterprise standards for security, reliability, and cost control.
