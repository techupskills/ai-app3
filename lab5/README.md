5. **Implement authentication patterns**
   ```bash
   code -d ../extra/lab5-auth_service.py ui_components/auth_service.py
   ```

6. **Create dashboard components**
   ```bash
   code ui_components/dashboard_components.py
   ```

7. **Complete dashboard components**
   ```bash
   code -d ../extra/lab5-dashboard_components.py ui_components/dashboard_components.py
   ```

8. **Start the production dashboard**
   ```bash
   streamlit run techcorp_dashboard.py --server.port 8501
   ```

10. **Access the dashboard:** http://localhost:8501
    
11. **Test different user roles:**
    - **Admin:** Full access to all features and analytics
    - **Supervisor:** Team management and escalation handling
    - **Agent:** Customer interaction and basic metrics

12. **Review production features:**
    ```bash
    # Check session management
    ls -la .streamlit/
    
    # Review security logs
    tail logs/auth.log
    
    # Monitor performance
