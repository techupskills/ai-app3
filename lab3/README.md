# Lab 3: MCP Architecture for Enterprise Scalability

**Purpose:** Refactor the customer service agent to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) for distributed architecture, service discovery, and enterprise scalability patterns.

**Time:** 30 minutes

**Business Context:** Transform TechCorp's monolithic customer service agent into a distributed microservices architecture using MCP, enabling horizontal scaling, service isolation, and independent deployments.

## Steps

1. **Review MCP enterprise architecture**
   ```bash
   ls -la mcp_services/
   cat mcp_services/service_registry.json
   ```

2. **Create the MCP customer service server**
   ```bash
   code mcp_customer_service_server.py
   ```

3. **Implement MCP server with enterprise patterns**
   ```bash
   code -d ../extra/lab3-mcp_customer_service_server.py mcp_customer_service_server.py
   ```
   **Enterprise MCP patterns to observe:**
   - Service registration and health checks
   - Authentication and authorization middleware
   - Request/response tracing across services
   - Rate limiting and quota management
   - Circuit breaker integration
   - Structured logging with correlation IDs

4. **Start the MCP customer service server**
   ```bash
   python mcp_customer_service_server.py
   ```

5. **Create the MCP client agent**
   ```bash
   code mcp_customer_service_client.py
   ```

6. **Implement enterprise MCP client patterns**
   ```bash
   code -d ../extra/lab3-mcp_customer_service_client.py mcp_customer_service_client.py
   ```
   **Key client patterns:**
   - Service discovery and load balancing
   - Retry policies and exponential backoff
   - Request correlation and distributed tracing
   - Graceful degradation and fallback strategies

7. **Test the distributed customer service system**
   ```bash
   python mcp_customer_service_client.py
   ```

8. **Try enterprise scenarios:**
   - **High Load Testing:** Multiple rapid queries to test rate limiting
   - **Service Resilience:** Stop server during query to test fallbacks
   - **Distributed Tracing:** Follow request IDs across services
   - **Performance SLA:** Monitor response times under load

9. **Monitor distributed system health**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   curl http://localhost:8000/metrics
   tail logs/mcp_server.log
   ```

10. **Optional: Start multiple server instances for load balancing**
    ```bash
    # Terminal 2
    MCP_PORT=8001 python mcp_customer_service_server.py
    
    # Terminal 3  
    MCP_PORT=8002 python mcp_customer_service_server.py
    ```

11. **Test service discovery and load balancing**
    ```bash
    # Client will automatically discover and balance across instances
    python mcp_customer_service_client.py
    ```

**Enterprise MCP Architecture Benefits:**
- **Horizontal Scalability:** Add server instances without code changes
- **Service Isolation:** Customer service, billing, and tech support can scale independently
- **Fault Tolerance:** Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures
- **Observability:** Distributed tracing across all services
- **Security:** Authentication, authorization, and audit trails
- **Deployment Flexibility:** Independent service deployments and rollbacks

**Production Features Demonstrated:**
- Service mesh patterns with MCP
- API gateway functionality for routing
- Distributed rate limiting and quotas
- Cross-service authentication tokens
- Performance monitoring and SLA tracking
- Graceful service degradation

**Best Practices Highlighted:**
- **Service Discovery:** Automatic registration and health monitoring
- **Circuit Breakers:** Prevent cascade failures in distributed systems
- **Correlation IDs:** Track requests across multiple services
- **Retry Policies:** Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Load Balancing:** Round-robin and health-based routing
- **Security:** JWT tokens and role-based access control

**Expected Outcome:** A production-ready distributed customer service system that can scale horizontally, handle failures gracefully, and provide enterprise-grade observability and security.

**Business Value:** This MCP architecture enables TechCorp to scale customer service independently from other systems, deploy updates without downtime, and maintain high availability during peak support periods.
